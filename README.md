# DALLâ€¢E Gallery

This is just a collection of insane AI generated images that I've
collected into a repo and made into a cheezy GeoCities style
gallery. This is also just reminding me that you don't really
need many 3rd party libs in react.

AI generated images are licensed under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

The fantastic background is from [FranticDreamer](https://www.deviantart.com/franticdreamer) on DeviantArt.
The image is called [Retrowave Synthwave Landscape CC0 8K](https://www.deviantart.com/franticdreamer/art/Retrowave-Synthwave-Landscape-CC0-8K-888232802).
